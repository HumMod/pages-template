# Pages Template
This repository houses the basic structure of the Github pages for published models.  These models require their own namespace for publication.

## How to use?
1. Download the [template](https://github.com/HumMod/pages-template/zipball/master).
2. Edit the `index.md` file.
3. Push your changes to a [new branch](http://pages.github.com/) of your model's repository.  The branch should be called `gh-pages`.
4. It will take a few minutes for the pages to show up.
5. Please let somebody know of your changes so that we may update other pages to show your models.
